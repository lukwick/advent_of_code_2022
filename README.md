# Advent of Code 2022

## What is Advent of Code? 

"[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other." 



## Folder structure

Each day is represented by its own folder (`/day?`). Within each folder you find a `README.md` which explains the challenge of the day. The `input_example.txt` contains the test input and the `input.txt` the actual puzzle input. The `day?.py` file contains my coding solution. The `results.txt` is the puzzle answers.
